There are codes for training and testing the DRL agent for dynamic service provisioning in multi-band elastic optical networks.

Run DRL_Agent_Train.py to train the DRL agent.  
Run test_pretrainedmodel.py to test the performance of the DRL agent with the best models saved during training.

Required packages for building the agents are:

stable-baselines3 1.7.0

sb3-contrib 1.7.0

torch 1.12.0
